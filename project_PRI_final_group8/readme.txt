a) Ad hoc search on the collection of documents

To run the code for this part in the command line just introduce:

    python project_a.py **scoring**

where the scoring is the method chosen by the user to present the results.
The possibilities for **scoring** include:

- 'BM25'
- 'Cosine'
- 'TF-IDF'

After this, the user must introduce the query in the command line and follow several
intructions, including the number of results to be presented and the three statistics
implemented.
