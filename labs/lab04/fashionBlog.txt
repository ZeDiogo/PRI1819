Ok letâ€™s be honest I love lipstick so much, I wonâ€™t be living off two shades all season ðŸ˜‰ BUT if the world came crashing down, beauty stores were closing, and I had only two shades to take with me it would be these. 1. This timeless matte nude and 2. This bold berry color. The nude is has been my go to for day to day mom life on the go, or for a night out if you are going more dramatic on your eye shadow. The bold berry is the perfect hue to tie in all things fall and make a statement with a bold lip paired with your favorite cozy sweater or date night dress.  Itâ€™s such an easy, simple way to update your look without having to change your outfit. Also I love Lancomeâ€™s lipsticks because they donâ€™t dry out your lips.

Also one of my favorite influencers, Camila Coelho, just launched a collection with them and the top of the lipsticks are in the shape of lips. They are SOO cute. Iâ€™m so excited to mix these into my looks.

What do you guys think of these colors?  Which do you prefer â€” the classic nude or the bold berry?
